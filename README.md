# Neon3D - JavaScript

Neon3D - JavaScript is a offspring I created of Neon3D. Neon3D is a college project build upon a FPGA, but I wanted to try out the flexibility of this code (literally copy pasting) form c to javascript. Just some minor tweaks were needed and I could use an already existing draw line function (SVG) in html5/javascript which sped things up a tiny bit. It is still software mode though. So do not expect any amazing performance. It's actually kinda poor...

### Goal
Just wanted to try converting a 3d engine from c to javascript... for funz....

### Version
0.0.1 - initial release

### Demo
You can find a demo here: [http://eldinzenderink.github.io/Neon3D-JavaScript/](http://eldinzenderink.github.io/Neon3D-JavaScript/)

### How and Why
The principal behind this is very simple, you have a one dimensional array containing information about nodes where lines have to be connected to. The array is interpeted like this: per 3 indexes: 1 node (x,y,z). per 6 indexes: 2 nodes (x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2).

### Tech

Neon3D - JavaScript uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

**Services:**
* [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/) - making CDN through GitHub available

**Scripts:**
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - duh


### Installation

This project is not meant as a plug and play library and probably never will be... because there are tons of 3D engines for javascript on the internet. Though... I won't stop you from using it :D.

### Development
If I feel like it.

### Todos
- MOOOOORRRREEEE..... SPEEEEEEDDDDDDD.
